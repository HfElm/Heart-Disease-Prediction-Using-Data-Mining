# Heart Disease Prediction Using Data Mining

This project applies data mining and machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data. The analysis is done using Python in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** Build a predictive model to classify whether a patient is likely to have heart disease.
- **Tools & Libraries:** 
  - Python
  - pandas, numpy
  - matplotlib, seaborn
  - scikit-learn (for machine learning models)

## Files

- `Heart_Disease_Prediction.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook with all the steps â€” data loading, preprocessing, visualization, and model training.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Heart-Disease-Prediction.git
   cd Heart-Disease-Prediction
   
2. Install the dependecies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
